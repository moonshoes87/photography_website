<STRONG><EM>To his Coy Mistress</EM></STRONG></FONT><P>by Andrew Marvell<P><BR>Had we but world enough, and time,<BR>This coyness, lady, were no crime.<BR>We would sit down and think which way<BR>To walk, and pass our long love's day;<BR>Thou by the Indian Ganges' side<BR>Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide<BR>Of Humber would complain. I would<BR>Love you ten years before the Flood;<BR>And you should, if you please, refuse<BR>Till the conversion of the Jews.<BR>My vegetable love should grow<BR>Vaster than empires, and more slow.<BR>An hundred years should go to praise<BR>Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;<BR>Two hundred to adore each breast,<BR>But thirty thousand to the rest;<BR>An age at least to every part,<BR>And the last age should show your heart.<BR>For, lady, you deserve this state,<BR>Nor would I love at lower rate.<BR><BR>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; But at my back I always hear<BR>Time's winged chariot hurrying near;<BR>And yonder all before us lie<BR>Deserts of vast eternity.<BR>Thy beauty shall no more be found,<BR>Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound<BR>My echoing song; then worms shall try<BR>That long preserv'd virginity,<BR>And your quaint honour turn to dust,<BR>And into ashes all my lust.<BR>The grave's a fine and private place,<BR>But none I think do there embrace.<BR><BR>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Now therefore, while the youthful hue<BR>Sits on thy skin like morning dew,<BR>And while thy willing soul transpires<BR>At every pore with instant fires,<BR>Now let us sport us while we may;<BR>And now, like am'rous birds of prey,<BR>Rather at once our time devour,<BR>Than languish in his slow-chapp'd power.<BR>Let us roll all our strength, and all<BR>Our sweetness, up into one ball;<BR>And tear our pleasures with rough strife<BR>Thorough the iron gates of life.<BR>Thus, though we cannot make our sun<BR>Stand still, yet we will make him run. <BR><BR><BR><BR>
