The ones that start with free_image are from stockfreeimages.com.  You need to credit the photo if you use it.  I believe the others do not need to be credited, but I should check before really launching the site.  The other rock ones came from: http://designm.ag/resources/free-stone-rock-textures/

And the paper ones, I'm not sure.
